  Research Neuroplasticity

<strong>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</strong>

Neuroplasticity has far-reaching implications and possibilities for almost every aspect of human life and culture, from education to medicine. Its limits are not yet known.

<strong>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</strong>

I believe that I'm 'not smart,' the realisation that I can change  through study and review is empowering.

<strong>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</strong>

Practice, practice, practice. Repeating an activity, retrieving a memory, and reviewing the material in a variety of ways helps build thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain.


<h3>Research Growth Mindset</h3>

<strong>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant?</strong>

In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don’t necessarily think everyone’s the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.”
