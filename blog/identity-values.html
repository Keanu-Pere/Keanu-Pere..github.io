      <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>

      <p>There was a time where I was the team leader of a night shift crew of 20. We were given an amlost near possible task to compelete but ended up smashing double the work that was required. Prior to the results me and my team produced, I had told them all if we can do this I would personally buy them all dinner the next time we are at work which was kfc. 
      The way i approach that better next time would be not looking at how hard something was but to understand that we enough help and drive we could do anything we set our minds to.</p>
      
      <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
      
      <p>The culture and the people around me helped me become the person I am today. I was always told by them to always treat people how you want to be treated, with fairness and respect for what the other person has to say or bring because we don't know what that other person is going through but all we can do is to see if they are ok and treat them kindly. Because what goes around comes around.</p>
      
      <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
      
      <p>With the strengths I have, I believe they will help me finish this course. I just have to remember to always ask for help when stuck and don't let my pride interfer with my learning.</p>
      
      <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
      
      <p>The only limitations I have are how hard I can be on myself to always improve there is no way that anyone is perfect because in life we all have something toimprove on to help us become a better person/self.</p>
      
      <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
      
      <p>When a work collegue of mine wouldn't to their end of work. It had got to the point where we were nearly in each other's faces but I had realised that that wasn't the right thing to do and told our boss what was going on and ended up me staying at work and the other guy getting suspened for a couple of days because he didn't want to do any work.
      The only thing I would do differently next time would be, not to lose my cool so fast and too take deep breaths and remind myself why I am doing this job and look at the bigger picture (My kids & Parnter) how are they going to eat if I'm not working. I will not let my ego get the best of me next time.</p>
