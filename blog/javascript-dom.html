<h4>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.?</h4>

An HTML file contains the structure of the page itself. It is kind of like the structure of the building.

A CSS file contains the styling of the page. It allows you to change colors, positioning and more. It is kind of like the design of the building itself.

A JavaScript file determines the dynamic and interactive elements on the page. It determines what happens when users click, hover or type within certain elements.

<h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life?</h4>

Control flow is like what you will do in a certain order to get that task done. For an
 example, getting the groceries. 
 You would:
 1. Look at what you have in stock.
 2. Write a list of food you need for the week.
 3. Write what you need for dinners for the week.
 4. Spend what you have to budget for food.
 Not like this:
 1. Go to the grocery store.
 2. Forget you didn't make a list go back home.

 And loops would be like how a chief follows instructions on how to cook, or manual book for when putting new furniture together.

<h4>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h4>

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, 
style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, 
it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. 
As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

<h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h4>

Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. 
In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value.
Properties in objects can be accessed, added, changed, and removed by using either dot or bracket notation. To get the value of the age key in our personobject with both dot and bracket notation, we’d write:

// Dot notation
person.age // returns 33
// Bracket notation
person['age'] // returns 33

We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed 
by their numerical position in the list. Just as object properties can store values of any primitive data type (as well as an array or another object), so too can arrays consist of strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other arrays.
Arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first item in an array has an index of 0, the second item an index of 1, and so on. For instance, let’s say we wanted to access the third item (‘Mexico City’) in the following array:

var vacationSpots = ['Tokyo', 'Bali', 'Mexico City', 'Vancouver'];

<h4>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.
  The first reason is reusability. Once a function is defined, it can be used over and over and over again. You can invoke the same function many times in your program, which saves you work. Imagine what programming would be like if you had
  to teach the computer about sines every time you needed to find the sine of an angle! You'd never get your program finished!
  Another aspect of reusability is that a single function can be used in several different (and separate) programs. When you need to write a new program, you can go back to your old programs, find the functions you need, 
  and reuse those functions in your new program. You can also reuse functions that somebody else has written for you.
  If you just want to use the function in your program, you don't have to know how it works inside! You don't have to understand anything about what goes on inside the function.
