  <h4>were blocked on a simple problem:</h4>
    <p>
       The issue I had I had ran into was on fizzBuzz was incorrect naming the array
       I was trying to grab from etc. function fizzbuzz(numberParameter) I would type 
       in i instead of numberParameter. So for help I had asked for help from another member
       in our cohort, and was pointing out that i should double check to see where I was pulling
       on. Well let me tell you how stupid I felt after discovering that simple issue. I was 
       back on track again. I now know for next time not to do that again and to always check my work from now on.
    </p>
  
  <h4>elegantly solved a problem.</h4>
    <p>
      JavaScript-kata 5-Builtin methods concatMyArray was the issue I felt most confident
      on. I had looked at the pseudocode and it all made sense in there. All I had to do
      was input 1 line of simple code and I knew it would pass. I felt like an evil genius 
      that had found the secret they had been looking for. I had learned that it pass to 
      take your time and read whats in front of sometime the answers are just sitting there.
    </P>
  
    <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h4>
      
      <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
        <p>
          With Pseudocode it helps breaking larger problems at hand into smaller 
          ones, so in the end it becomes easier to solve or get an understanding 
          on what to do next.
        </p>
      <h2>Trying something</h2>
        <p>
          With this technique, I can get into a really deep rabbit hole and try 
          hundreds of different codes at a time but I don't always get it right
          trying it this way but now and then it does work but give me the biggest 
          sense of relief that I had did it all on my own. 
        </p>
      <h2>Rubber ducky method</h2>
      <p>
        For this technique I need to start investing time in to trying this techniques
        I have 0 confidents in this since I never use it.
      </p>
      <h2>Reading error messages</h2>
      <p>
        This one is a good one, it tells you everyting you need to know that is wrong with
        your code and what line number it is.
      </p>
      <h2>Console.logging</h2>
      <p>
        With this I use this all the time now its the my go to with everything I'm 
        testing. This helps me know after I finish typing in some code that if it goes or not.  
      </p>
      <h2>Googling</h2>
      <p>
        Google is also my bestfriend. If I can't understand why I'm getting errors I 
        google the answer and 8/10 it gives me the answer that I'm looking for.
      </p>
      <h2>Asking your peers for help</h2>
      <p>
        I have no problem asking my peers for help when it comes to it. I will usually position
        in the discord chat to see if anyone can help me understand whats my problem at hand.
      </p>
      <h2>Asking coaches for help</h2>
      <p>
        I also will ask coaches for help but sometimes as a last resort. I would try
        everything else before asking coaches for help but I will if everything else fails.
      </p>
      <h2>Improving your process with reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I feel like the more I do reflections, the more I open up about myself.
        Which I see as a good thing, where as before I would be more closed off
        when dicussing topics to certain people.
