      <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>

      My long term goal is to end up working in the tech industry where i can work from home or in the office one day. 
      
      <h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h4>
      
      One of my main strength is my ability to retain information quite well and how fast i learning different things compared to others. But that also can back fire on me too like for an example if I learn everything about a job and there is no progress on how I can improve, thats when i start getting bored.
      
      <h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
      
      A human skill I will like to see develop is compassion for other's and to help people out in need of help.
      
      <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
      An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
      
      So when I will be working with other's I will be patient and listen to what they all have to say or pitch it for group projects and I will bring up my idea's if they think it;s a good idea to include what i have to say aswell. If things are not going good and I feel like things are getting too much for me, I will simply tell them I won't be long I'm just going outside for some fresh air I will be back in 5.
      For when I get stuck on something, I will give myself a certain time period to solve it on my own if I can't do it that time period I will ask other's for help.
      
      <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
      
      I don't expect too much from our Facilitation team, the only thing would be when we are in need of help if they could point us in the right direction which they already do so great at.
      
      <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
      
      Yes so with me and my partner we discuss what we have planned for the week and try solt me in a time frame where it is not going to conflict with my studies with Dev Academy or my Whanau time.
