 <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    <p>
       Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to perceive, interpret, demonstrate, control, 
       and use emotions to communicate with and relate to others effectively and constructively. 
       This ability to express and control emotions is essential, but so is the ability to understand, 
       interpret, and respond to the emotions of others
    </p>
  
  <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
    <p>
      IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. 
      EQ tests measure your ability to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions.
    </p>
  
  <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
    <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify and regulate one's emotions and understand the emotions
       the others. A high EQ helps you to build relationships, reduce team stress, defuse conflict and improve job satisfaction.
