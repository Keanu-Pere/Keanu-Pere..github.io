  <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      I had learnt that it is okay to ask for help from others if I am struggling and don't get what is at task.
      Also another thing I have learnt about myself is too always reflect on myself, to see how 
      how I can improve on the next time I encounter that problem and the last thing would be, helping others in need of help.
      Whether that be with what task they are stuck on or adivce on core concepts. 
    </p>
  <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
    <p>
      Having empathy in learning and programming is important because I would wanted to be treated
      in the same way as others and have that respect for the other person without any judgement from them aswell.
      It's not fair to not take in other people's feeling on how they feel or what they have to bring
      to the table because in reality they could have an really good idea on something you are doing together
      that you wouldn't of thought of in the first place.
      With self-awareness , if that person is pissing you off or doing something that triggers you,
      instead of reacting to them on how you feel. You can come up with plans to help avoid 
      all unnecessary drama and move forward from there.   
    </p>
  <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      The whole thing about core learning has surprised me to be quite honest. All of these things on Core
      learning we are doing are all new to me. At the start of foundations I would be a little
      closed off from how I do my reflections now. In a way it is good to have so you know what you can do 
      better to help improve yourself mentally and also helps with the tech side of things as well.
    </p>
  <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      The most challenging things for myself for core learning was opening up more about myself,
      just because of my last jobs there was no core valves only performance mattered to them. 
      But moving forward from there it is getting easier to do the more I surround myself with
      these task.
    </p>
  <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p>
      In reality we can only go so far until we hit a stand still, but with core learning your able to reflect on
      how well or bad we done or how could I do it better next time. These things help us know 
      what we need to work on to help better ourselves.
    </p>
  <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p>
      Well at first if your new to this way of learning it can look that way, but the more you
      do it, the more you see yourself improving not matter how big or small it may look because 
      thats better than what you were doing before and blaming others for your own mistakes but in reality
      we need to check on ourselves to see how well we are doing or what is bothering us at the time.
