      <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
     
      My long term goal is to end up working in the tech industry where i can work from 
      home or in the office one day. 
      
      <h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h4>
      
        One of my main strength is my ability to retain information quite well and how fast 
        I learning different things compared to others. But that also can back fire on me too 
        like for an example if I learn everything about a job and there is no progress on how 
        I can improve, thats when i start getting bored.
      
      <h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
      
      A human skill I will like to see develop is compassion for other's and to help people out in need of help.
      
      <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
      An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
        <p>
          So when I will be working with other's I will be patient and listen to what they 
          all have to say or pitch it for group projects and I will bring up my idea's if 
          they think it's a good idea to include what i have to say aswell. If things are not 
          going good and I feel like things are getting too much for me, I will simply tell them 
          I won't be long I'm just going outside for some fresh air I will be back in 5.
          For when I get stuck on something, I will give myself a certain time period to solve 
          it on my own if I can't do it that time period I will ask other's for help.
        </p>

      <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
        <p>
          I don't expect too much from our Facilitation team, the only thing would be 
           when we are in need of help if they could point us in the right direction which 
           they already do so great at.
        </p>
      
      <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h4>
        <p>
          Yes so with me and my partner we discuss what we have planned for the week 
          and try solt me in a time frame where it is not going to conflict with my studies 
          with Dev Academy or my Whanau time.
        </p>  
      <h1>Learning plan Bootcamp</h1>

      <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          My long term goal is too one day after Bootcamp I ended up landing me a job in my dream
          career in tech. I haven't loved something like this in a long time. But first I would like to pass the course then go from there.
        </p>
      
      <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
        <p>
          My strength in picking up things quickly has helped me alot in foundations but there has been times
          where I had mental blocks. But taking short breaks fixed that. But my biggest limitations would be asking for help 
          when I'm stuck on something too long. I try to get it done without help but I need to be more open to help.
        </p>
      
      <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
        <p>
          My biggest non-technical challenge would self reflections after finishing each task for the day.
          I like to rush to the next tech challenge and start it straight away but I will plan a better time
          frame for myself to do reflections.
        </p>
        
      <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
        <p>
          I would love to see how my self reflecting goes by the end of Dev academy because I can see the small effects it has
          to help better myself. I would like to get to a point where self reflecting becomes second nature to me.
        </p>
        
      <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
        <p>
          My expectations for the Bootcamp team would be what they are already doing their best at
          and that is checking on us to see what is bugging us.
        </p>
        
      <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
        <p>
          For myself I expect myself to be giving it my all no matter how hard or easy the task may be at the time.
          Also I wish to have a bigger insight on JavaScript aswell since I am struggling with that the most.
